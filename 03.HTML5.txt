		<p> is a TAG 
			but <p>HELLO</p> is an HTML element, so tag+content=element
		
		some tags have evolved, initially website, html was for pc/mac, 
			nowadays it's also for phone/tablets/screen readers that for some don't understand <b> or <i>
				so tag like <strong> came to replace <b>, <em> to replace <i>
