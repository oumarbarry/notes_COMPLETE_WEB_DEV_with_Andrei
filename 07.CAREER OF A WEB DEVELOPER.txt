CAREER OF A WEB DEVELOPER: In demand developers are problem solvers not just coders
	
	Career Options:
		Job Titles:
			- Backend, Frontend, Full Stack, Web Developer
			- Mobile Developer
			- Software Developer (can create almost all type of apps: web, mobile, desktop, etc)
			- Software Engineer

		Type of Work:
			- Entrepreneurship, Freelance (with Upwork plateform maybe aha)
			- Startups
			- Big Tech Companies
			- Ad Agencies
			- Remote Work

	Developper Fundamentals:
		Try to figure out code bug by yourself first
			then after if still blocked, STACKOVERFLOW
				so Googling and Stackoverflow are the best friend of developers

	What if i don't have enough experience:
		keep in mind that job postings are put in order to weed out the weak candidates
			by just making job sound harder, 
				tougher than it really is in order to remove junior developpers from applying
				
		ask yourself is this job going to be tough ?
			because if you apply to something that you're 100% qualified for, where is the room to grow ?
	
		how can you have good experience if you're just getting started ?
			as with everything there's the regular way and 
				there's the smart way : 
					you see, experience doesn't come just from working at a company
					there's many ways to demonstrate experience without a past job
						and it's by : github, website, big projects, blog
		
		Getting the interview:
			GitHub:
				it's a great way to show that you actually code, that you have built projects
					ways to improve github profile or to just add more experience is:
						first: (start to) make a lot of commits (to get a good history of your work)
						last: contribute, participate as you can less or more in open source projects

			Website:
				if you're a web dev, it's good to have your own website where to showcase your skills
				this is something to speak about in interview and maybe why not how you built it
				
				however, keep in mind that you don't need to build the webiste from scratch
					there's a ton of free templates/ressources that can be use like with:
						create-tim.com
						mashup-template.com
					take example of : rocketgirl.herokuapp.com
				
			1-2 Big Projects:
				having something like 1 big project make you sound more impressive 
					than somebody that just built a ton of tiny projects
				if you have no work experience, talk about these 1-2 big projects
					on the work experience part in the resume
			Blog:
				another thing you can add to your resume,
					especially if it's related to a technology you or the company are using
				Medium: 
					medium.com allows anybody to just post a blog post
					it also allows to push an article to a specific popular publishers to get more readers
					so create an account on it and start posting
			
		Talk about your portfolio projects, maybe talk about your website and how you built it,
		talk about maybe a hackathon you participate or open source projects you have worked on
		write a blog post on a specific technology that the company you're applying to is using
		
			all of that answer this question: do you have experience ?
			
		also know there's many things that you can add that are not developper
			but that can make you a great employee
				so if you have them, you can add skills like:
					the ability to manage people and communicate with others
		so know that any skill that is related to getting the job can be included
		
		'i have only 6 months / 1 year of coding experience': never show things like that on your resume
