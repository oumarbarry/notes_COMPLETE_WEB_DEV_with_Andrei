Once you are in your forked project directory in your command prompt :

1.	Type git remote -v and press Enter. You'll see the current configured remote repository for your fork.

	a.	```git remote -v```

	b.	```origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)```

	c.	```origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)```

2.	Type git remote add upstream, and then paste the URL you would copy from the original repository if you were to do a git clone. Press Enter. It will look like this:

	git remote add upstream https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/PROJECT_NAME.git

3.	To verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork, type ```git remote -v``` again. You should see the URL for your fork as origin, and the URL for the original repository as upstream.

4.	Now, you can keep your fork synced with the upstream repository with a few Git commands.
	One simple way is to do the below command from the master of your forked repository:

	git pull upstream master
