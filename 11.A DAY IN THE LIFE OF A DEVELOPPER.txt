9:00am:
	at your office, you check the TRELLO board
		to see what is done, what to do like maybe fixing braching conflict...

10:00am:
	the STANDS UP meeting with the SCRUM MANAGER, the PRODUCT OWNER, and the concerned team
		this meeting is to check what have been done yesterday, so act what we're gonna do today
			or maybe if you're blocking on something or you're having issue, you can ask some team members

10:30am:
	back to your desktop, working on bugs or new features according to the trello board
		like updating the read me file

12:00am: lunch

14:00pm:
	after working on the read me file, you make a PR (pull request)
		and then usually tend to check, review others PR and if you're authorize merge these PR

15:00pm:
	some companies will also make QA (Quality Analysis),
		QA is about essentially making sure that the changes 
			that have been implemented doesn't affect our web app, 
				check if it still works on phone, on all browsers
					so it's all about making sure that our features or bugs are fixed

16:00pm:
	if everything passed: if the QA is goog, if our PR gets APPROVED by our team --> :)
		so we go to trello to update task from doing to done


WHETER YOU ARE BUILDING A PRODUCT YOURSELF OR YOU'RE THE ONLY OWNER,
	you still had to use these techniques to just keep yourself accountable and making sure that tasks are getting done
		BECAUSE BEING A WEB DEVELOPPER 
			IS ALL ABOUT BREAKING UP BIG TASKS LIKE BUILDING NETFLIX INTO SMALL MANAGEABLE CHUNKS
				and each day you're just working one chunk at a time
