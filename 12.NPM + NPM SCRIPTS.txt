NPM:
	npm is a PACKAGE MANAGER for javacript and the world's largest software REGISTRY
		so PACKAGES are located in the NPM REGISTRY, 
			registry that so keeps track of these submitted packages
		ANYONE CAN SUBMIT PACKAGES

		Packages (or MODULES) contains: a package.json file + one/many javascript file(s)
			package.json is a META file that describe the package

	npm usage
		pros: well you get expertise, all that collective knowledge from others
		cons: not all packages are good code and also adding these files can make your project size bigger

	yarn: still use the npm registry, it's also a tool like npm to grab things from the npm registry

	there's usually three types of packages that you can find on npm:
		first type is the packages that you can use on the browser like jQuery
		
		the second type is ones that give you new commands that you can use on the CLI
		
		finally the third type is ones that you can use on nodejs on the backend like Express

	npm stands for NODE PACKAGE MANAGER
		it was initially built for node
			but it was so good and so popular 
				that you can now use it for the front-end

	typical project : 3 must things to do nowadays when starting a web project based on js
		. html, css, js
		. git, github
		. config package.json

Installing-Using Packages:
	example of packages to install:
		react, LODASH, LIVE-SERVER

		live-server: 
			a development server that runs on stactic and dynamic websites
		lodash: 
			you can think of it as an extension of javascript,
				it adds more functions to the language, 
					per example it add a looott of methods to process Arrays

	npm allow us to install packages in two ways: LOCALLY and GLOBALLY
		globally means it will be accessible on all the computer, usually it will give you new CLI commands
		locally means it's accessible only inside your project folder, your project javascript files

		examples:
			locally: npm i lodash (older way of doing this was: npm i --save lodash)
			globally: npm install -g live-server

	as soon as we do npm install <package> (a local installation) 
		and we have a package.json file inside the folder,
			it will add it to our dependencies (== packages that our website needs to work)
				and the way package.json finds these is that these all lives under the 'node_modules' folder

	IN A STATIC PROJECT LIKE background-generator:
		- to test the installation of lodash, add this in the 'script.js' file
			var _ = require('lodash')
			var array = [1,2,6,7,8,9]
			var newArray = _.without(array, 2)
			console.log( 'array : ',  newArray)

		- npm install -g browserify
		
		- browserify script.js > bundle.js

			if you don't bundle the js file, the browser will not understand the code above
				it's browserify(+commonjs) that allow us to use the 'require' syntax in the browser
					'require' syntax that is built-in in node.js

		- then replace in the html file: <script src="script.js"></script> by <script src="bundle.js"></script>

		CONS:	
			everytime you made a change in script.js you need to bundle it
				it's annoying but without node.js, in a static project, this is how things work

			in this project, we're only using the 'without()' method
				but our bundle.js file is massive 
					because it includes the whole lodash library where we use only one function

		So be careful of that when you work with NPM : that is a lot of beginners just start installing a ton of packages without thinking how much weight they add to their project

		it's a better idea to first assess wheter you need a package as a team (if you work with a team)
			and add it to the project
				if it saves you time
				if it's really well-written
				if it has a big community around it

		another thing is that because we now have dependencies, 
			we need to make sure that our website always has a certain version of these dependencies

		PROS:
			package.json serves as a GREAT DOCUMENTATION
				for our project dependencies and their SEMVER (SEMANTIC VERSIONING)
				semver

			and the biggest benefit is that with npm a project is much easier to share with other developers
				all another dev needs to test out your project is the package.json + the js file(s)
			so because the package.json lists out all the dependencies of a project
					when they get the file, inside the project folder, 
						they just have to run: "npm install"
							that will download all the dependencies inside a new created node_modules

			last things, devDependencies and NPM SCRIPTS
				devDependencies are packages that are only needed for development and testing
					so it's packages that will never be send in production
				
				//package.json
				"scripts": {
					"build": "browserify script.js > bundle.js && live-server"
				}
				// now with that write in the package.json of our project, we can run the following command:
					npm run build 
					npm run <script_name>		


WHY UPDATE PACKAGES ?
	because a library is something that's constantly evolving
		new fixes are made, new features are added
			and most importantlynew security issues are solved/patched
	
	in Github, in the Security tab, it lists out your projects security alerts
		and you can even automated security fixes
