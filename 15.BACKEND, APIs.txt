BACKEND
	the backend dev is the person that is in charge of working with servers and databases
		and a server is responsible for whatever you get in the browser
	the main goal of backend is to make sure that when a HTTP request is made from the frontend,
		make sure that we get a response back as fast as possible with correct data
	so backend development is all about making sure that we return correct ressources to the front

	before backend devs used mostly the LAMP stack configuration:
		with linux as OS,
			only apache for serving files,
				php for the logic of the website
					and mysql for the databases
		this config is mostly for basic websites

	the nowadays config is named APPLICATION SERVER:
		the server runs mostly on Linux, 
			with APACHE or NGINX but on top of apache we have things like 
				Node Server for NODE.JS or Gunicorn for DJANGO 
					that manage ROUTING of URLS
			and for databases, we have mostly PostgreSQL, MongoDB...

		this is the config for nowadays what we call WEB APPLICATION i.e complex websites

		but for larger website like facebook, twitter, what will change in this config is the scale
			so for these we will have:
				MULTIPLE DATABASE
					(the database will be replicated in many other computers),
				
				MULTIPLE APPLICATION SERVER
					(i.e a copy of the website logic on different computers)
				
				and A LOAD BALANCER 
					similarly to apache/nginx, it listens HTTP requests and check 
						if an application server is busy,
							it transfers the request to another server
								so in resume it balances the load of server


APIs: 
	it's just a tool for data communication according to certain rules
		some apis are public (free), some are private, someones need an authentication key etcc
		apis send back data in xml format, and mostly JSON format
